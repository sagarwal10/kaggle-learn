# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Path of the file to read. We changed the directory structure to simplify submitting to a competition
iowa_file_path = '../input/train.csv'

data = pd.read_csv(iowa_file_path)

# from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
# my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from xgboost import XGBRegressor

y = data.SalePrice
